**MIME** (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types are used to identify the type of content served by a web server. When a web server serves a file, it includes a MIME type in the response header to inform the client (usually a web browser) about the type of content being sent. This helps the client handle the content appropriately. 
Why Add This Mapping?
When you have CA certificates in your web server's document root or in a directory accessible by the server, adding this mapping allows clients (such as web browsers) to recognize and handle these CA certificate files correctly
